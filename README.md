### Objective: 

The primary goal of this project is to develop a web-based Flask application that analyzes and presents the data collected by NASA of the 2019 Australian Bushfires. With bushfires being a pervasive and regular phenomenon in Australia, significantly shaping the continent's landscape over millions of years, the project aims to show the NASA satellite data through interactive features and insightful data visualizations. The web app will offer information on 2019 Australian bushfire locations, all satellite readings taken and collated daily data for a glimpse of the serverity of the bushfires during this period.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nagarajbhat/australian-bush-fire-satellite-data-nasa

**What we have used to analyse & present:
-	Python Flask Powered API
-	Javascript
     - including D3, Plotly & Chart.js libraries
-	HTML/CSS
     - including Bootstrap library
-	SQL (PgAdmin)
-   Carto plugin

Requirements
For Project 3, you will work with your group to tell a story using data visualisations. Here are the specific requirements:
1.	Your visualisation must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
2.	Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:
o	A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
o	A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
o	A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualisation (must be approved)
3.	Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4.	Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
5.	Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
6.	Your final visualisation should ideally include at least three views.
For this project, you can focus your efforts within a specific industry, as detailed in the following examples.
